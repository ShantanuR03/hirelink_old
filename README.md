Hire-Link is a comprehensive platform developed by Team Dracarys to streamline the hiring process for both recruiters and candidates. The platform consists of a Next.js website for recruiters and a Flutter mobile application for candidates. It aims to automate the traditional hiring process, providing a seamless experience for both parties.


## Problem Statement

The traditional hiring process can be time-consuming and inefficient for both job applicants and recruiters. Applicants are often required to manually
apply for multiple jobs and recruiters must sift through numerous resumes to find suitable candidates. It involves a lot of manual work and is often time
consuming and expensive. Sorting through numerous applications and resumes can be overwhelming, and sometimes candidates with the right
qualifications are overlooked. This can lead to missed opportunities for both parties and a lack of diversity in the hiring process.


## Drawbacks of the Traditional Hiring Process

- Traditional hiring processes can take an average of 42 days to fill a position, resulting in longer hiring cycles and increased costs. (Source: Society for Human Resource Management).
- Manual filtering of applications is time-consuming and prone to human errors and bias, with recruiters spending an average of 23 hours per hire on manual screening. (Source: Glassdoor).
- A poor candidate experience can lead to negative reviews and deter future applicants. About 60% of job seekers report a negative candidate experience. (Source: Talent Board).
- Poor hiring decisions can result in costs of up to 30% of the employee's first-year earnings, including recruitment and training costs. (Source: Society for Human Resource Management).
- Lack of transparency and feedback in the hiring process can lead to a poor candidate experience, with 83% of candidates reporting that a negative interview experience can change their opinion about a role or company. (Source: LinkedIn)
